With the console, you can access your account, projects, collections/data, and test other services right from the terminal. This helps to view and manage your account from your terminal.

which basically is to *interact with collections/data*, which involves:

- Creating collection
- Fetching collection(s)
- Updating collection(s)

## How to get started

You'll need to have [the latest LTS version of NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/download).

You'll also need a package manager, either `npm` or `yarn`

Run this in your terminal to get the necessary tools if you don't have them

```bash
npm install --global yarn ts-node
```

Once that's ready, run the following in your terminal

```bash
git clone git@github.com:codepraycode/nobox-console.git

# After cloning is complete
cd nobox-console

npm install

# Run console
ts-node index.ts

# According to your package manager.
```

> After cloning the repo, create a `.env` file, and add some environment variables. The format is present in the `.env.example` file in the root directory of the project.

Run the console, and enter the `help` command to see how to use it.
> The help document is self-explanatory, you'll get it, don't worryüëçüèæ
